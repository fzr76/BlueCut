# BlueCut

This program is intended for those who do VHS to digital conversions. It basically scans all the frames in an mp4 video and all blue frames are removed from the video. 

The "Fully Functional no GUI.py" is a script that can be ran from the command line.

The "main.py" Is a fully functional version of the program with a super basic GUI made with PySimpleGUI that has two buttons, one to open the mp4 file desired, and two, a button to process the blue frames out. Once it has completed there will be a popup window telling you it has finished and how many frames were detected. The popup window will just tell you how many selections have been made and removed, not the actual amount of frames.

Once the video is done processing a file will be created on your desktop named "output.mp4" This is the completed video!
